# Project: Student Agent Assistant

# üß† Goal:
# Build a local AI-powered assistant hosted on a personal server (Linux Mint) using Ollama,
# capable of:
# - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
# - Tool use (function calling)
# - Simple agent-like behavior (multi-step reasoning)
#
# Then expand it with powerful custom features for personalization, memory, context, and utility for school and home use.

# üî® Tech Stack (MVP):
# - Ollama (local LLM: LLaMA 3 / DeepSeek / Mixtral)
# - Python (Flask or FastAPI)
# - Chroma or Supabase (for vector search / memory)
# - Whisper.cpp (voice input)
# - Piper TTS (voice output)
# - Optional frontends: Streamlit, React, Telegram bot

- **System Panel**: Memory management, status monitoring, and data export
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

- Modern card-based design with clean typography
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

### üß† Memory System Features:
- **Persistent Conversation History**: All interactions stored in SQLite database
- **Context Awareness**: Last 6 messages automatically included in conversation context
- **Autonomous Memory Search**: LLM automatically decides when to search memory for context
  - No explicit commands needed - just ask naturally
  - Example: "Can you help with my exam?" ‚Üí LLM searches for "exam" automatically
- **Manual Memory Search**: Ask questions like:
  - "What did I say about math?"
  - "Did I mention Python?"
  - "Have we talked about exams?"
  - "Remind me about my project"
  - "search: calculus" (direct search)
- **Memory Commands**:
  - `memory` or `memory status` - View current memory statistics
  - `clear memory` - Reset conversation history
  - `help` - Show all available commands
- **Automatic Logging**: All user and assistant messages automatically saved
- **Conversation Summaries**: View activity summaries for recent periods

### üß† Per-Project Summary Memory System:
**Intelligent Context Awareness for Long-Term Projects**

The Per-Project Summary Memory System maintains lightweight, persistent summaries of each project's conversation history, enabling the LLM to understand project context without token bloat:

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Summarization**: Generates intelligent 3-5 bullet point summaries using the LLM
- **Context Injection**: Project summaries are automatically injected into every conversation
- **Smart Triggers**: 
  - Initial summary generated after 10+ messages
  - Auto-refresh every 25 new messages
  - Manual generation on-demand
- **Project-Scoped**: Each project maintains its own contextual memory
- **Visual Indicators**: üìù for projects with summaries, üìÑ for those without

**How It Works:**
1. As you chat within a project, the system tracks message count
2. When thresholds are met, the LLM automatically generates a summary covering:
   - Key topics and themes discussed
   - Important decisions or conclusions reached
   - Current project status or progress
   - Any ongoing tasks or next steps
3. This summary is injected into every future conversation, providing the LLM with project context

**Usage:**
- **Web Interface**: Click "Generate Summary" button to create/update summaries
- **CLI Commands**: 
  - `projects` - List all projects with summary indicators
  - `generate summary` - Create/update summary for current project
  - `view summary` - Display current project summary

**Benefits:**
- **Context-Efficient**: Long-term project awareness without full history injection
- **Scalable**: Works regardless of conversation length
- **Autonomous**: Automatic management with minimal user intervention
- **Project-Aware**: Clean separation between different projects and contexts

### ü§ñ Autonomous Memory Search:
The assistant now intelligently searches its memory without being explicitly told to:

```
User: "Can you help me prepare for my exam?"
LLM: *automatically searches memory for "exam"*
Assistant: "I remember you mentioned a calculus exam on Thursday that you're stressed about. 
          Let me help you prepare! What specific topics would you like to focus on?"
```

**How it works:**
1. User mentions something that might reference past conversations
2. LLM detects context dependency and calls `search_memory` tool automatically
3. Relevant conversation history is retrieved and injected into the response
4. Assistant provides contextually-aware answers using past information

### üîç Memory Search Examples:
```
Manual Search:
User: "What did I say about my Python project?"
Agent: üîç Found 2 result(s) for 'python project':
       1. Jun 24, 2025 at 2:30 PM ‚Äî üë§ user: I'm working on a Python project...
       2. Jun 24, 2025 at 2:31 PM ‚Äî ü§ñ assistant: That sounds interesting! What kind...

Autonomous Search:
User: "How should I approach my project?"
Agent: Based on our previous discussion about your Python web scraping project for CS class,
       I'd recommend starting with the requests library and BeautifulSoup...
```
