# Project: Student Agent Assistant

# 🧠 Goal:
# Build a local AI-powered assistant hosted on a personal server (Linux Mint) using Ollama,
# capable of:
# - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
# - Tool use (function calling)
# - Simple agent-like behavior (multi-step reasoning)
#
# Then expand it with powerful custom features for personalization, memory, context, and utility for school and home use.

# 🔨 Tech Stack (MVP):
# - Ollama (local LLM: LLaMA 3 / DeepSeek / Mixtral)
# - Python (Flask or FastAPI)
# - Chroma or Supabase (for vector search / memory)
# - Whisper.cpp (voice input)
# - Piper TTS (voice output)
# - Optional frontends: Streamlit, React, Telegram bot

# 🚀 Post-MVP Feature Ideas:
# 1. Long-term memory (semantic)
# 2. User model / learning preferences
# 3. Subject-aware context switching
# 4. Time-aware scheduling (with calendar integration)
# 5. Self-assessment engine (quizzing, reflection)
# 6. CLI or system tool control (local code helper)
# 7. File awareness (upload docs, ask questions)
# 8. Multimodal interface (voice + text)
# 9. Transparent logic/debug output
# 10. Self-auditing agent loops

# 🎯 Target Users:
# - College student (you)
# - (Later) classmates, family, or open-source community

# 🗓️ Current Status:
# - Chat design phase, MVP feature list defined
# - RAG, tool, and agent plan in place
# - Ready to begin implementation planning
